a stacking window manager
=========================

beware! here fester emissions from the mind of a total novice c-programmer.

goals
-----

- learn c

- get as much use out of the designated mod-key as possible. eg: modifier
  pressed without any other keys; press and hold; sequences of press and
  wait...

- provide nice chunky snapping to make it easy to create nice aligned
  layouts.


broken list / todo
------------------

- fetching window names
- focus on window quit?


big todo
--------

- mod-long-press -> window list
- workspaces or window-configuration-registers
- minimize


not implemented
--------------

- window hints
